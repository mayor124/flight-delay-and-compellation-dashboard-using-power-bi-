# Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze flight performance data to identify delay and cancellation patterns across different airlines and cities. The goal is to help aviation stakeholders improve scheduling, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## questions answerded

Which city had the most flight activity?
→ Atlanta leads with 0.35M total flights.

Which airlines faced the most delays?
→ United Airlines and Southwest Airlines top the delay list.

What’s the primary cause of flight delays?
→ Airline/Carrier-related issues (57.3%) are the main reason for delays.

How do cancellations compare to delays?
→ Delays are far more common (41%) than cancellations (1%).

What’s the overall flight punctuality rate?
→ 57.99% of flights are on time, indicating room for improvement in operational efficiency.

## Project Process

Data Collection: Imported raw flight data including city, airline, delay status, and cancellation reasons.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, standardized flight records, and filtered invalid entries.

Data Modeling: Built relationships between flight details, delay causes, and performance metrics.

Visualization: Created dynamic visuals to show total, delayed, and cancelled flights, top cities, and major delay causes.

Insight Extraction: Found that most delays were airline-related, with Atlanta leading in total flight volume and delay rates.

## Project Insights


Total Flights: Over 1.9 million flights were recorded, showing a strong level of air traffic across major U.S. cities.

Delays: About 790.5K flights (41%) experienced delays — a significant operational issue that impacts airline reliability.

Cancellations: Roughly 28.6K flights (1%) were cancelled, showing minimal but notable disruptions.

Top Cities:

Atlanta (0.35M) and Chicago (0.29M) lead in flight volume, likely due to being major airline hubs.

Airlines Most Affected:

United Airlines, Southwest, and Spirit Air experienced the most delays — possibly linked to higher traffic or network size.

Delay Causes:

Airline/Carrier issues caused 57.3% of all delays, followed by Weather (28.3%), showing internal inefficiencies are a bigger factor than external ones.

Performance Ratio:

On-time: 58%

Delayed: 41%

Cancelled: 1%
This indicates nearly half of flights experience disruptions.
## Project Conclusion

The Flight Delay and Cancellation Dashboard provides clear insights into airline performance and flight reliability across major U.S. cities. The analysis reveals that while most flights operate on schedule, a large portion—over 40%—experience delays, primarily due to airline or carrier-related issues rather than external factors like weather.

By identifying top delay-prone airlines and cities, this dashboard enables aviation stakeholders to target operational inefficiencies, improve resource planning, and enhance customer satisfaction. Overall, the project demonstrates how data analytics can turn flight data into actionable intelligence for better decision-making and improved on-time performance.
