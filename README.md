# Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze flight performance data to identify delay and cancellation patterns across different airlines and cities. The goal is to help aviation stakeholders improve scheduling, reduce delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Project Process

Data Collection: Imported raw flight data including city, airline, delay status, and cancellation reasons.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, standardized flight records, and filtered invalid entries.

Data Modeling: Built relationships between flight details, delay causes, and performance metrics.

Visualization: Created dynamic visuals to show total, delayed, and cancelled flights, top cities, and major delay causes.

Insight Extraction: Found that most delays were airline-related, with Atlanta leading in total flight volume and delay rates.

## Project Insights


Total Flights: Over 1.9 million flights were recorded, showing a strong level of air traffic across major U.S. cities.

Delays: About 790.5K flights (41%) experienced delays — a significant operational issue that impacts airline reliability.

Cancellations: Roughly 28.6K flights (1%) were cancelled, showing minimal but notable disruptions.

Top Cities:

Atlanta (0.35M) and Chicago (0.29M) lead in flight volume, likely due to being major airline hubs.

Airlines Most Affected:

United Airlines, Southwest, and Spirit Air experienced the most delays — possibly linked to higher traffic or network size.

Delay Causes:

Airline/Carrier issues caused 57.3% of all delays, followed by Weather (28.3%), showing internal inefficiencies are a bigger factor than external ones.

Performance Ratio:

On-time: 58%

Delayed: 41%

Cancelled: 1%
This indicates nearly half of flights experience disruptions.
## Project Conclusion

This analysis shows strong year-over-year growth in both revenue and quantity, with stable customer engagement.
While the average unit price remained constant, the overall sales increase indicates higher demand.
The business has strong market penetration in Asia and Europe, suggesting a balanced global presence.
Continued focus on high-performing regions and customers like India and Bangladesh can drive even greater revenue growth.
